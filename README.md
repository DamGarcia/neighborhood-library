The most interesting piece of code was the section containing the method ShowCheckedOutBooksScreen(). Within this method, we needed to take what was altered in our other method ShowAvailableBooksScreen() and prompt the user to essentially reverse what was done. However, it is not as simple as writing the code backwards and undoing a book check out. After working with peers and carefully prompting ChatGPT to review the code and identify any syntax or logical errors, I was able to complete the code and have a better understanding of how the process of completing this would work; I am working on strengthening my ability to think logically to complete each task.
